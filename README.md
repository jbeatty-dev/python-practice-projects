# Practice Projects

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a repository collection of beginner-friendly projects as I learn Python and coding for the first time. Each folder contains one of these mini projects which I intend to use to exercise my learnings on key programming concepts. 

---

## This repo serves as: 

- A playground for experimenting and learning
- A way to journal my progress as I build the fundamentals 
- A space to explore Python topics like variables, functions, loops, and more 
- Something I hope to look back on in the next several months as a self-reflection on how far I've come. You got this, future Josh!

## Projects 

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`number-guessing-game`][def] | A command-line guessing game where you try to guess a random number between 1 and 20 in five attempts.

---

## Tools Used

- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code 
- Git & Github 

--- 

## Future Plans 

- Add new mini projects to practice and learn new concepts 
- Explore object-oriented programming (OOP) 
- Try GUI-based or web-based versions 
- Refactor early projects as my skills improve to fully express my creativity through code 

---

## Considerations

- When running projects, use "python3" for running the code 
- Example: 

```bash
python3 guess.py
